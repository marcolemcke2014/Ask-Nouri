# ðŸ“± AI-Powered Menu Scanner App - Paquapp_v1

This is a mobile-first, installable web app that uses OCR and AI to help people find meals that match their health goals.

## Core Flow
Scan a menu â†’ OCR extracts text â†’ AI analyzes it â†’ Results are personalized and saved

## Stack
- Next.js 14 + App Router
- Tailwind CSS (Mobile-first)
- Tesseract.js (WASM OCR)
- OpenAI / Claude API
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Edge)
- Hosted on Vercel or Replit

## Folder Philosophy
Russian doll modular system â€” every function or feature lives in its own file.
If something breaks, only that piece should need fixing.

## Structure
See `RULES_FOR_AI.md` for deeper details.

# ðŸ¤– RULES FOR AI CONTRIBUTORS

To all future AI and developers: Please follow these rules to evolve the app safely.

## 1. Modular Structure
- Each function/component has its own file
- No bloated pages or endpoints

## 2. File Placement
- Logic â†’ `/lib`
- Types â†’ `/types`
- UI â†’ `/components`
- State logic â†’ `/hooks`
- API endpoints â†’ `/app/api/`

## 3. Feature Expansion
Adding a new feature?
- Add types â†’ `/types/feature.ts`
- Add logic â†’ `/lib/feature.ts`
- Add API â†’ `/app/api/feature/route.ts`
- Add UI screen â†’ `/components/screens/FeatureScreen.tsx`

## 4. Style Guide
- TypeScript only â€” no `any`
- CamelCase filenames in `/lib`, `/types`, `/hooks`
- PascalCase filenames in `/components`
- Always comment complex logic
- Use constants or enums instead of "magic strings"

## 5. Security
- API keys go in `.env.local`
- Never hardcode secrets
- Use `process.env.XYZ` consistently

## 6. Reusability
- If a logic block is reused 2+ times, extract it to `/lib`
- If a UI element is used in 2+ screens, move it to `/components/ui`

## 7. Cleanup
- Delete dead code
- Use descriptive function names
- Refactor when in doubt

## 8. Mobile-first Priority
- Always test on small screens
- Use Tailwind's mobile-first utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)

## Duplicate/Unnecessary Files

The following files are duplicates or have been replaced by the new structure:

1. `pages/scan-history.tsx` - REPLACED BY `pages/scan/history/index.tsx`
2. `pages/scans.tsx` - DUPLICATE OF `pages/scan-history.tsx`
3. `pages/history.js` - OLDER VERSION WITH MOCK DATA
4. `pages/profile.tsx` - REPLACED BY `pages/profile/index.tsx`
5. `pages/settings.js` - REPLACED BY `pages/profile/settings.js`
6. `pages/results.js` - REPLACED BY `pages/results/index.js`
7. `pages/login.tsx` - REPLACED BY `pages/auth/login.tsx`
8. `pages/signup.tsx` - REPLACED BY `pages/auth/signup.tsx`
9. `pages/choose-plan.tsx` - REPLACED BY `pages/auth/choose-plan.tsx`
10. `pages/payment-success.tsx` - REPLACED BY `pages/auth/payment-success.tsx`

## Navigation Flow

1. User lands on `pages/index.tsx`
2. If logged in â†’ redirect to `/scan`
3. If not logged in â†’ show login page (`/auth/login`)
4. After signing up â†’ select plan (`/auth/choose-plan`)
5. After payment â†’ see confirmation (`/auth/payment-success`)
6. New user â†’ start onboarding
7. Returning user â†’ go to dashboard or scan page
8. Scan page uses `ScanScreen` component for camera functionality

## Recommendations

1. Use the new structure for all new development
2. When ready, delete the duplicate/unnecessary files listed above
3. Update any navigation links to point to the new file locations
