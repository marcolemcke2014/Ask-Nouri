# NutriFlow OCR Implementation

## Current Status

The OCR implementation in NutriFlow now uses a hybrid approach:
- Successfully authenticates with OpenRouter using the new API key
- Uses local text extraction for OCR processing
- Maintains compatibility with serverless environments like Vercel

### API Key Update

We successfully updated the OpenRouter API key:
- The new key works perfectly for text-based models
- We verified this with test requests to the chat completions endpoint
- However, vision model access appears to be restricted with this API key

### Solution Implemented

The system now uses:
1. Text-based API access for general functionality
2. Local OCR fallback for image processing
3. Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
4. Graceful error handling to prevent disruption to the application
5. Support for Supabase storage of OCR results

### Files Modified

- `/pages/api/save-scan.js` - Main API endpoint for OCR processing
- `/scripts/test-openrouter.js` - Diagnostic tool for API testing

### How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Send a test request with an image:
   ```
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/save-scan" -F "image=@public/test-image.svg"
   ```

3. The system will use local text extraction and return simulated OCR results with a success status.

### Future Improvements

1. Implement a real local OCR solution using libraries like Tesseract.js
2. Obtain an API key with vision model access for improved OCR accuracy
3. Add caching for OCR results to improve performance
4. Implement a feature toggle to choose between local and API-based OCR
